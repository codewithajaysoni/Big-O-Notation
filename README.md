Complexity plays an important role in coding. Users may experience a decline with an increase in complexity. This is why questions related to complexity are an important part of programming interviews. This module is a complete guide to the complexity of different data structures. It starts with the concepts and formulas related to complexity. Then, we'll solve different problems with different complexities. At the end of this module, we'll look at some interview questions related to code complexity, as well as a cheat sheet that will help us with the interview questions.
